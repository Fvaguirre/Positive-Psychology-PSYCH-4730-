## The Role of Culture in Positive Psychology (continued)

* 'The Good Life' varies from person to person
* Culture and individual traits influence development, recognition, and enhancement of strengths
* All about perspective

### Measuring 'Universal" strengths
* traits and characteristics can be defined differently in different cultures
* There are differences between cultural groups in definitions, manifestations, and values placed on various constructs
* Linguistic equivalent of a measure does not equal conceptual equivalence

### Multicultural Mindset as Strengths
* Multicultural Personality Questionnaire (MPQ)
  * 5 Factors:
      1. Cultural Empathy
      2. Open-Mindedness
      3. Emotional Stability
      4. Initiative
      5. Flexibility
* Multicultural personality related to cultural adjustment and quality of life outcomes/well-being

### Final Thoughts on Culture and Positive Psych
* More research required with emphasis on cultural facets
* Determine how "culture counts" with every client or research participant interaction
* "Wise Man and the Gulf" - good life is in the eye of the beholder
* life's contexts affect how strengths are developed...

### Happiness
* Factors:
  1. Perspective
  2. Gratitude

## Chapter 5: Living Well at Every Stage of life

### Developmental psychology
* The study of how humans grow, develop, and change throughout the lifespan
* Has always studied adaptability and positive functioning
* Research focused on what is working
* Focus on people's self-correcting tendencies

- Childhood = birth to age 11
- youth = 12 to 25
- Adult = 25 to 60
- Older adult = 60 to death

### Overview of Theories of Developmental
* Table in Chapter 5 slide number 4

### Living Well at Every Stage of life
* Resilience researchers and positive youth developmentalists have studied positive traits and outcomes of young people
  * Positive youth developmentalists
    * ...
  * Resilience researchers
    * ...
### Resilience in Childhood
* 1970s research on resilient children
  - those who "bounced back" from adversity
* What is Resilience?
  * Two approaches to classifying resilience:
    1. Inferential Concept approach
      * Significant adversity present
      * Bounced back? But how do you define bouncing back? What about cultures
    2. Dimensional ...
      * ...
* Bounced back to what?
  * return to normal functioning
  * Functioning above and beyond expectations
  * depends on expectations from the community
    * could be positive educational outcomes, healthy within-family functioning, psychological well-being
* Also dependent on culture
* Cultural differences in conceptualization...
  * e.g. rather than study reasons for poor school achievement of Latino students, study those with high achievement
  * e.g. American Indian enculturation (strong ties to heritage) was significantly related to resilience

### Roots of Resilience research
* case Studies
  * E.g. Louis Zamperini
* research on building blocks of resilience
* research on similarities and differences among those who bounce back vs.those who don't

* Research:
  * At-risk children of Kauai
  * over 80% "bounced back" later in lifespan
  * those that did had a supportive, caring adult in their lifespan

* Dr. Emmy Werner - "The Mother of Resiliency"
  * Person-centered resilience researcher
  * Cohort of 700 children from Kauai (1955 - 1995)
  * 1/3 of the children at risk were invulnerable to the risk Factors
* 2 Primary characteristics for resiliency:
  1. born with outgoing dispositions (more likely to draw in others for support)
  2. Able to engage several sources of support
  3. Better care during infancy, intelligence, and perceptions of self-worth also contributed to positive outcomes.

* 2/3 did develop significant problems in childhood or adolescence
* However, most 80% bounced back by age 35
* Those that did bounce back attributed their resiliency to the support of a supportive adult figure

* Factors for resilience
  * in the child:
    * problem-solving skills, self-regulations skills, easy temperament in infancy, positive self-perceptions; self efficacy; faith and a sense of meaning in life, a positive outlook on life, talents valued by self and society, general appealingness or attractiveness to others
  * In the family and close relationships:
    * Positive attachment relationships, close relationships to competent, prosocial, and supportive adults, authoritative parenting (high on warmth), positive family climate, organized home environment, postsecondary education of parents, parents with qualities listed as protective factors with the child
