gifts and benefits we've received

### Emmons: How Does Gratitude Work?
1. **Gratitude allows us to celebrate the present.** it magnifies positive emotions.
* Gratitude makes us appreciate the value of something, which makes us less likely to take
it for granted
* Gratitude allows us to be more active in life (as opposed to passive). Noticing and looking for what you're grateful for allows us to be more present.

2. **Gratitude blocks toxic, negative emotions**, such as envy, resentment, regret--emotions
that can destroy our happiness. Study by Alex Wood in 2008 in the Journal of Research Personality shows that gratitude can reduce frequency and duration of depression.
* You cannot feel envious and grateful at the same time.

3. **Grateful people are more stress resistent**. Studies show that in the face of serious trauma, adversity, and suffering, people who have a grateful disposition recover more quickly.

4. **Grateful people tend to have a higher sense of self-worth**.
