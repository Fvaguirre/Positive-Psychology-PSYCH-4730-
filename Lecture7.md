### Historical Study of Emotions
* More focus on negative Emotions
  * Negative emotions can harm the body but also have survival value
* Less focus on positive Emotions
  * Seen as having hedonic (pleasure-based) value
* Focus has gotten more balanced recently

* Development of the **PANAS** by Watson and Clark
* Measures both positve and negative Affect
* positive and negative affect are not polar opposites, they are independent

### Positive Affect
* some people have a lot of positive Affect
  * Feel great much of the time
  * good things bring them pleasure and joy in abundance
* Some people have little positive Affect
  * Don't feel great
  * Don't jump for joy at success

* People can be happy but might not have a lot of positive affect
* Seligman's friend, Len, who is low in positive affect, but he is happy. So, people can be happy even if they don't have much positive emotion
